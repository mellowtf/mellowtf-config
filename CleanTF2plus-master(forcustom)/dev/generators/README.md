# dev/generators

This folder contains scripts that perform a certain type of operation (such as model removal, or flattening textures) on large amounts of files from a list.

- materials_fullbright makes vmt files use fullbright shaders
- models_null supplies null files to the models, to make them not load
- remove deletes files generated by previous lists (for things such as nohats headsfeet)
- scripts_copy copies certain script files
- scripts_find_and_replace replaces all instances of a string with another string
- textures_flat makes vtf files be one color, potentially with resizing
- textures_nodraw makes vtf files be completely clear
